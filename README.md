**Goals of this project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Pipeline description

My pipeline consists of 5 steps.

First, the image is grayscaled.

In the second step the image is blured with gaussian filter.

As third step the edges are marked by canny filter.

In the 4. step the region of interest is masked with predefined polygon.

The step 5 is applying the hough transform to the masked segment for finding the lines

Finally the lines detected by the 5 steps above are painted on the original picture.

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines()
function by identifying the left lane with negative slope and right lane with
positive slope. After that find the two points on left and right lane with smallest y coordinate.
From these points interpolate to the two corresponding points for left and right lane with help of the slope.

### 2. Potential shortcomings

One potential shortcoming would be what would happen when the angle of the camera taking pictures changes.
As of now hard coded values are used for identifying the segment and for Hough transformation parameters.
Current implementation doesn't work with video driving a curve.
Another issue observed in the yellow video example is that at few places the
line jumps to the left or right for a short time.
I assume in the current pipeline is room for improvements to handle different road conditions.


### 3. Possible improvements

A possible improvement would be to not use hard coded values.
As of now I don't know how to avoid using hard coded values,
maybe there is a way to adapt the parameters of segment selection
and Hough parameters dynamically.
Another possibility might be to have a predefined set of values per car model.
Since the camera will be mounted on a fixed position on same car model.
To handle curvy roads the draw_lines function must be adapted, currently simple linear
extrapolation is performed.
